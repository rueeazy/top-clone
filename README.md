Clone of The Odin Project website using my own grid framework

This project is part of The Odin Project's Curriculum. [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework?ref=lnav]

The goal of this project is to build a clone of a website using my own CSS grid based framework that I created.

The website I chose to replicate is The Odin Project's website. [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework?ref=lnav]

My grid based framework was inspired by CSS Grid and uses a 12 column grid to layout items on the page. The finished replica can be found here.
